####Chapter 1 Notes

Two of most important characteristics of good design are *discoverability* and
*understanding*. Discoverability: Is it possible to even figure out what actions
are permitted and where and how to perform them? Understanding: What does all it
mean? How it the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls
and settings mean?

#####The Complexity of Modern Devices

All artificial things are designed.

It is the duty of machines and those who design them to understand the people.
It is not our duty to understand the arbitrary, meaningless dictates of machines.

#####Human-Centered Design

Good design requires good communication especially from machine to person,
indicating which actions are possible, what is happening, and what is about to
happen.

####Fundamental Priciples of Interaction

Discoverability results from appropriate application of five fundamental psychological
concepts: *affordances*, *signifiers*, *constraints*, *mappings* and *feedback*.

#####Affordance

An affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the
capabilities of the agent that determines just how the object could possibly used.

#####Signifiers

Affordances determine what actions are possible. Signifiers communicate where the
action should take place.

The term signifier refers to any mark or sound, any perceivable indicator that
communicates appropriate behavior to a person.
